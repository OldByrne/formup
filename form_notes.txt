yes database so the teams in dropdown are present
and maybe daily pulls onto DB rather than always relying on external API calls

API contender:
https://live-score-api.com/documentation/reference/15/football_data_history_matches

backend:
depending on controller GET
get all teams from whatever the league request is
do the calcs on the teams
simple calcs mode:
	get last 6 results of each team
	+3 for win, +1 for draw and total them
	order teams by points, alphabetical if even values
smart calcs mode:
	assign number values to every team depending on league position (their strength, will need to be small value)
	each match team gets +3 for win, +1 for draw as well as +opponent strength value
	also get some bonus for away game
	opponent strength and home/away could resolve into a star rating for difficulty
	use win/draw/loss points (3/1/0) as well as star? could work
	order teams by points, unlikely to have evens
requesting league and form type:
	serving on controller:
		primary priority:
		ordered teams of league in either mode by form
		secondary priority:
		the actual previous matches (opponent, result, score)
		league table over 6 games (simple only i think, smart wouldnt work)
		
frontend:
web app first. maybe then android/iOS?
home page where league and also mode is selected
results page where league table is populated depending on league teams and the mode
back button to home page
refresh button?
make it all look nice
